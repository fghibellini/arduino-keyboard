# ARDUINO KEYBOARD

Uses 2 [Arduino micro](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-micro) s (one per hand).
The arduinos are connected through a [I2C](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) line using the Arduino [Wire library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire).

## KEY LAYOUT

Keys are organised in 6 columns and 4 and 5 rows respectively on left and right hand (fifth row of right hand is the thums section which has only 3 columns).
Columns are numbered 1-6 and rows are numbered A-E (left-to-right and top-to-bottom respectively).
**e.g.** the **F** key's label is **C5**.

## Very much Work In Progress
